On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a big forum with millions of people, all my friends are there, I meet new friends, they say some funny stuff, some cute stuff, I get all of my news there. It&amp;rsquo;s super useful to share my work, and to reach people who might like it. I love just saying randomly what&amp;rsquo;s on my mind for comedy, at the attention to whoever might hear it and find this funny.</description></item><item><title>Emoji region flags</title><link>http://toasters.rocks/emoji-region-flags/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 20:36:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://toasters.rocks/emoji-region-flags/</guid><description>&lt;p>For this project, I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired by the &lt;a href="https://www.emoji.bzh">#emojibzh&lt;/a> movement which attempts to include the flag of the Brittany region of France in the emoji repertoire. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at it and here&amp;rsquo;s what I found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ecco the dolphin</title><link>http://toasters.rocks/ecco-the-dolphin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 02:47:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://toasters.rocks/ecco-the-dolphin/</guid><description>Welcome to the second installment of my code experiments! This time we&amp;rsquo;re gonna look into the weird effect used in the background of messages in Ecco the Dolphin for the Sega Genesis (or MegaDrive, if you&amp;rsquo;re asking someone outside the Americas). I got the idea from Twitter user @Foone who helpfully reverse engineered the game ROM (with Twitter user @Reaper_man02) to figure out how it works and wrote an implementation in Python.</description></item><item><title>trippy perlin noise</title><link>http://toasters.rocks/trippy-perlin-noise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 18:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://toasters.rocks/trippy-perlin-noise/</guid><description>Now that I can easily embed JavaScript on this blog, I should put here some of my experiments and weird code that does nothing, cause why not. This one is some colored Perlin noise made using p5.js, it would be pretty cool as a background for something, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
It is quite simple using the noise function, one the simplest things you can do with it is color = noise(x, y, time) for each pixel on the canvas, usually you make it grayscale but this time I&amp;rsquo;m generating 3 of them for each color component (red, green, blue) with a different seed.</description></item></channel></rss>
