      <description>Yeah, I complain a lot about the fact I don&amp;rsquo;t write on my blog. I moved it again, this time on Ghost, after I found out I had free web hosting and it could run Node.js apps on it, so let&amp;rsquo;s try this. It was a bitch to install, though, as if Murphy&amp;rsquo;s law was playing against me. If it has a chance to fail, then it will fail. It took like 3 days, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.</description>

      <title>Toasters Rocks: The Reboot</title>

      <description>Yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s try this out, cause why not. It used to be Tumblr (which you can still follow here), but I recently switched to Write Freely, just to see how nicer it is. And looks like it works so far.
A while ago I realized I followed way too much people and it distracts me a lot from writing long texts, that and there was way too much NSFW to go there at school, so I kinda stopped going there.</description>
