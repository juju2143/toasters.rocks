A brand new blog. But this time, the story is quite interesting.
Genesis The first iteration of this blog was basically my Tumblr blog. By November 2018, I became largely disinterested by Tumblr due to various reasons, and I found this blog engine called WriteFreely, written in Go, could do federation so the blog posts would show up in people&amp;rsquo;s Mastodon feeds, effectively replicating some of Tumblr&amp;rsquo;s social features.</description></item><item><title>New blog, again</title><link>http://toasters.rocks/new-blog-again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 07:57:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://toasters.rocks/new-blog-again/</guid><description>Yeah, I complain a lot about the fact I don&amp;rsquo;t write on my blog. I moved it again, this time on Ghost, after I found out I had free web hosting and it could run Node.js apps on it, so let&amp;rsquo;s try this. It was a bitch to install, though, as if Murphy&amp;rsquo;s law was playing against me. If it has a chance to fail, then it will fail. It took like 3 days, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.</description></item><item><title>Toasters Rocks: The Reboot</title><link>http://toasters.rocks/toasters-rocks-the-reboot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://toasters.rocks/toasters-rocks-the-reboot/</guid><description>Yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s try this out, cause why not. It used to be Tumblr (which you can still follow here), but I recently switched to Write Freely, just to see how nicer it is. And looks like it works so far.
A while ago I realized I followed way too much people and it distracts me a lot from writing long texts, that and there was way too much NSFW to go there at school, so I kinda stopped going there.</description></item></channel></rss>
