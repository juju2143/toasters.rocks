*This article was originally published on Tumblr, reposting it here for completeness.*

Well. I didn’t blogged that much in the past year or two on this toasters dot rocks blog, for some reason. My Tumblr timeline was looking like a disaster. Kinda like Facebook, actually, but that’s another kind of disaster. Oh well. I probably should blog a bit more and publish some texts I usually just condense in 280 characters on Twitter. Kind of a diary.

So yeah. A ton of stuff happened since then, in the past year or two. Dropped school, got a job in web development and now I’m working on a rather big project with a bunch of friends related to podcasts and content creators. (BTW, I’ll let you know when it’s ready :)) So yeah, after being generally terrible in college and having stayed way too long there, thanks to a Youtuber, podcaster and entrepreneur friend, I’m now in a situation one could just dream of. You might want to get all of the diplomas to get far in life, but if you’re creative enough, you don’t need to… Anyway, I can’t wait to see this project taking off, cause it’s a pretty good concept overall, it just needs a lot of thinking and challenges to overcome.

I’ve also been thinking a lot of my pet project, Zarmina, it’s also a project I wanna see done, I worked quite a bit on it lately, I finished the script for a demo, but I prefer putting the time on this other project since, well, this pays my bills :)

Anyway, can’t wait what live is gonna give me next, who knows?

So yeah, stay tuned for more entries in my diary…
