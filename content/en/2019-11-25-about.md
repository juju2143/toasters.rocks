Hi, I'm J. P. Savard. (Obviously a pen name. Or is it?) Also known as Juju or Yuki.

I'm just a random freelance programmer from Québec City, Canada. I write things sometimes. It feels good.

Here you will find random musings about life, development logs, code experiments, educational content, or anything I deem worth to put on this silly blog. Might write in French sometimes, if you don't understand, it might not concern you, look somewhere else.

None of my thoughts represent the opinion of my employers, clients, anyone I might know or even myself from next week. They often agree with me, but take nothing for granted.

If you like the content I put here, please tip me on [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/juju2143)!
