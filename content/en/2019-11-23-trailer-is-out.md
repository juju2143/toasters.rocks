New trailer for the project, it's not the complete game but I hope you'll like it :) It's been done with Ren'Py cause it's gonna be the intro to the game and I wasn't able to get a good video editing software working on my computer... You can see it straight on the game's page or if it's buggy there's a YouTube video.

For you English speakers, don't worry, there will be an English version soon. Once I figure out how the translation module works. It's kinda weird.

Anyway. If you liked it, please throw me some money here or on Patreon, that'd be super appreciated. But in all, I hope you have fun!
